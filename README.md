###  Objective
Set up the project structure and implement basic data handling using a custom file module.

---

##  Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS (installed for future steps)
- File System (fs.promises)


. Project initialized using npm  
. Installed express and ejs  
. Created custom fileHandler module  
. Implemented read() and write() using fs.promises  
. Created employees.json with sample employee  
. Logged employee data in terminal when server starts  

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Start server:
   node server.js

3. Open browser:
   http://localhost:3000

The server successfully reads employee data from employees.json 
using a custom module and logs it to the terminal without crashing.
